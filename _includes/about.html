    <p>Vancouver Design Week (VDW) is a collaborative platform, a call to action and an invitation to us all to immerse in design and its transformative potential.

    <h4 class="ff-secondary f-wb">What we believe</h4>
    <p>Vancouver Design Week (VDW) is a collaborative platform, a call to action, and an invitation for us all to immerse in design and its transformative potential. We believe in the problem-solving capabilities of designers. Regardless of their specialization, they are essential in shaping a better future. VDW offers a city-wide platform (which extends to satellite communities within Metro Vancouver) to connect, educate, and inspireâ€”empowering individual and collective agency.</p>

    <h4 class="ff-secondary f-wb">Vancouver Design Foundation</h4>
    <p>Vancouver Design Week is an initiative of Vancouver Design Foundation (VDF). VDF is a non-profit organization which works to further our region&rsquo;s design value and impact while helping to define our authentic design identity. We reinforce our city&rsquo;s design ecosystem and focus on four key areas: social innovation, creativity and culture, the built environment, and public engagement. We deliver partner-funded programs and campaign to raise awareness of the value of design.</p>
