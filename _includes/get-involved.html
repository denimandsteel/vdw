          <p>Gastronomic experiences are influenced by great design; and the collaborations between design palettes create dynamic conversations about taste and place. Tastings are a chance to access the inspirations behind the local lounges we love... amidst signature samples and a design conscious crowd. <em>Note: Tastings hosts set their own space limits and prices to manage capacity and cover costs</em>. </p>
