        <h1 class="u-mt--l">The Quick Version</h1>
        <p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free festival experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of festival participants, volunteers, or staff in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any festival venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and online media. Festival participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the festival without a refund at the discretion of the festival organizers.</p>

        <h2 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">The Expanded Version</h2>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour must comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.</p> 

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the festival organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the festival with no refund.</p>
        
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of festival staff immediately. festival staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded VDW t-shirts or buttons.</p>

        <p>Festival staff will help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the festival. We value your attendance.</p>
        
        <p>These rules apply to all events produced by, or registered to be part of Vancouver Design Week</p>

        <h2 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">Reporting Process</h2>
        <p>"We" and "VDW" in this document refer to the Vancouver Design Week organizers. This document describes our policy for handling reports of unsafe behaviour and other code of conduct violations. VDW's primary concern is the safety of our attendees, and we appreciate the assistance of all of our attendees in creating and sustaining a culture of safety at VDW.</p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">Who Can Report a Problem?</h3>
        <p>Anyone whose behaviour causes you concern. We will give all reports equal consideration. Our handling of reports will not be influenced by factors such as the social status or festival role of anyone involved in the situation.</p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">What Problems can be Reported?</h3>
        <p>Any behaviour or pattern of behaviour that violates our code of conduct. If you feel someone's behaviour is dangerous or harmful to you or others, if someone's behaviour makes you feel afraid or very uncomfortable, or if someone is actively making it difficult for you or others to participate in the festival, we would like to know about it.</p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">When can I Report a Problem?</h3>
        <p>At any time; however, we request that reporting take place as soon as possible during or after an incident, especially if you believe that someone may be causing problems for multiple people at the festival. Reports will be taken seriously and handled appropriately regardless of when they are made.</p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">How do I Report a Problem?</h3>
        <p>At the festival, approach any staff or volunteer member identified by a VDW t-shirt or staff badge. After the festival, email <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;" href="mailto:info@vancouverdesignwk.com">info@vancouverdesignwk.com</a></p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">If You Make a Report</h3>
        <p>Festival representatives will offer you the use of a private space, listen to your report, and interview other people (witnesses, the person the report is about) as necessary. They will decide whether immediate action needs to be taken. After the festival, the report and any actions taken will be reviewed. This group will determine whether multiple-year action also needs to be taken. You will be informed of any action that VDW takes in connection with your report, and your identity will not be disclosed unless required by law enforcement.</p>
        <h3 class="f-tt-uc u-mt ff-secondary golf">If a Report is Made About You</h3>
        <p>If someone tells us that you have violated the code of conduct, festival representatives will ask to speak with you about it in a private place. If you decline to be interviewed, we may ask you to leave the festival. If, after speaking with you, we believe that you have violated the code of conduct, we may ask you to change your behaviour or leave the festival, or take other actions. We will not take action until we've spoken with you and anyone else involved and done our best to get a clear picture of what happened.</p>
        <p>If we believe that no violation occurred, you are welcome to go about the festival as usual. We will not attempt to mediate or carry messages between you and the person who made the report. If someone deliberately makes a false report about you, that is itself a code of conduct violation and we will take appropriate action in response.</p>
