  <h1><span>Questions? We have answers.</span></h1>
  <div class="faqs">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>When is VDW?</h2>
      <p>Vancouver Design Week's inaugural event was May 2014, the organizing team is targetting 2016 for the next event.</p>

      <h2>Where is VDW?</h2>
      <p>Vancouver Design Week is happening all around Vancouver. A full event calendar and maps will become available as events and locations are confirmed. <a class="newsletter-link" href="#">Sign up for our newsletter</a> to hear when the event roster is announced.</p>

      <h2>How do I register? Is it free?</h2>
      <p>Vancouver Design Week is composed of a wide range of events and happenings. Some require registration and some don&rsquo;t; some are free and some aren&rsquo;t. Registration and ticketing are managed by their individual hosts/organizers, so be sure to confirm details before heading out.</p>

      <h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
      <p>Like the week&rsquo;s make-up, there are a diversity of ways to get involved - host a tour, submit an event, become a supporting partner, volunteer, or make a donation (VDW works under a not-for-profit model).</p>
      <p>But most importantly, show up, speak up and stand out! Exchange perspectives with (other) designers, try new things, ask questions, share your thoughts and be a part of the conversation!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faqs">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Can anyone list an event as part of VDW?</h2>
      <p>VDW invites local designers, design organizations, and design thinkers to challenge and expand the Vancouver design conversation. If you&rsquo;re a part of the Vancouver design scene and are interested in creating a design-related event, <a href="http://vancouverdesignwk.com/opencall"></a>our call for submissions is now open</a> and has further details.</p>
      <p>If you don&rsquo;t have any programming to propose, but want to share your space - your studio, your workshop, your cafe/shop/restaurant/tasting room, consider joining our Open Doors lineup.</p>

      <h2>How is VDW possible?</h2>
      <p>We hoped you&rsquo;d ask.</p>
      <p>Vancouver Design Week is a not-for-profit social enterprise. Created by a passionate team of volunteers from across design disciplines - with advisory and core committees composed of some of the city&rsquo;s most renowned design institutions, entrepreneurs, educators, thinkers, and makers - Vancouver Design Week has been willed into being by a shared belief that design is imperative to improving the quality and potential of our city.</p>
      <p>Help us make this vision a reality by showing up, speaking up, and standing out.</p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>Vancouver. Edge city. A territory on the geographic and cultural periphery. A place where people come to escape the confines of convention and a place with a unique aptitude for freethinking, incubating and instigating.</p>

          <p>The results: creation of global phenomena - Occupy, Greenpeace, and &lsquo;Vancouverism&rsquo;; pioneering of West Coast Modernism; and home to a long list of world-class designers and innovators. And yet... &ldquo;although some of the world&rsquo;s greatest designers live/work in Vancouver they are (here at home) unknown, undervalued and disconnected from one another&rdquo; [Jane Cox, Cause+Affect] - limiting our potential for agency as both a culture and a city.</p>
          <p><strong>Vancouver Design Week is an opportunity to redress this.</strong></p>

      </div>
      <h2 class="second">Mission</h2>
      <p class="bump">Vancouver Design Week is city-wide platform, invitation and call to action - to celebrate established and emergent design talent; to spotlight broad spectrum design innovation; to cross-pollenate and empower designers and design-thinkers across disciplines, and to leverage the potential of design for transformative agency and holistic capital, in Vancouver, and beyond.</p>
