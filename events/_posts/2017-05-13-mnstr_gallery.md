title: "MNSTR GALLERY"
description: "MNSTR Creative Studio + Gallery combines graphic design, art, printmaking, photography, and curation. We are a new studio in Mount Pleasant run by Ben & Oli, a husband and wife duo, and part of the space is also our home. <br> <br> We'll exhibit our individual and collaborative work in the coming months and eventually curate shows for other artists. We were previously in Singapore and Australia the past 10 years to live + work before finding Vancouver as a new home at the beginning of 2016. <br> <br> For VDW, we're opening our studio  to showcase our physical artworks and to play a slideshow of our past and current projects.<br> <br> Oil will demonstrate his screen printing process during the show, the final step in his creative process taking digitally created imagery and applying it to the canvas by hand. Visitors can drop in any time throughout the process and watch how the prints are made. <br> <br> A VFX animator by day, Beng is a self taught screenprinter who creates poppy narrative-driven social commentary art works. These artworks will also be available for purchase through our website soon.<br> <br> We'll have a studio lighting set up for still life/food and a workstation to demonstrate workflow. Having a background in graphic design has helped her a lot with the creative direction in her photography work, styling and editing skills.<br> <br> Their collective experiences and skills have brought them to create their little monster (MNSTR) here in Vancouver. â€œWe hope to contribute to the art and design scene in the city and are keen to connect with the creative community here... people with different focuses from designers, artists, craftsman, and those who are enthusiastic about visuals. <br> <br> Drop by and hang with us!"
