title: "TEALEAVES X Pantone #PaletteForYourPalate at Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver"
description: "Join us for a refreshing spring cocktail from the TEALEAVES x Pantone #PaletteForYourPalate Collaboration, created by the Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver’s mixologist, Todd Zimmerman!<br> <br> TEALEAVES is one of the very few tea blenders in the world, and we take precision very seriously. Why? Because in luxury, it’s the details that matter. <br> <br> TEALEAVES blends teas specifically for color, alongside aroma and taste, with understanding that “the first taste is with the eyes”. This philosophy inspired the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\" http://paletteforyourpalate.com/\">#PaletteForYourPalate</a> project in collaboration with Pantone Color Institute and 30+ world-class chefs and mixologists. Explore the exhibit of tea + color + mood at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\" http://paletteforyourpalate.com/\"> paletteforyourpalate.com</a>.<br> <br> Curious? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://paletteforyourpalate.com/cocktail_7A_peppermint\"> Try a recipe yourself</a>."
