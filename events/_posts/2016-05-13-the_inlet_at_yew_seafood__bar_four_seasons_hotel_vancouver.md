title: "The Inlet at YEW Seafood + Bar, Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver"
description: "TEALEAVES is one of the very few tea blenders in the world, and we take precision very seriously. Why? Because in luxury, it’s the details that matter.   TEALEAVES blends teas specifically for color, alongside aroma and taste, with understanding that “the first taste is with the eyes”. This philosophy inspired the #PaletteForYourPalate project in collaboration with Pantone Color Institute and 30+ world-class chefs and mixologists. Explore the exhibit of tea + color + mood at paletteforyourpalate.com.  Join us to enjoy a refreshing spring cocktail from the #PaletteForYourPalate Collaboration, created by Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver's Mixologist, Todd Zimmerman!"
