title: "A Magical Place"
description: "Entering the studio will be a door to a magical world where technology, nature and human beings meet. People will be diving into a world of light from the projection of a moving laser light through a glass art previously designed to deliver a strong message of positive impact and strong actions we can have. They will be immersed into nature with all their senses: a colorful visual and a relaxing music."
