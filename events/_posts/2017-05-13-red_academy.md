title: "RED Academy"
description: "RED Academy is hosting a four-part journey to learn about the design process and our work with community partners in the city.<br> <br> In Research Republic, learn how designers are not locked away in a room. We’re active in learning everything about our users. We use interviews with curated questions to discern the wants and needs of the clients/users.<br> <br> Participate in two activities that’s about one part UI (User-Interface) design with a visual test and one part UX (User Experience) design by conducting an interview. <br> <br> Join us at Designer’s Den to go on a magical carpet ride to learn about the design process through short, punchy explanations. There will be lots of opportunities to practice what we preach through mini activities that involving mood boards, typography, colour theory and rapid iteration in 10 second quick-draws.<br> <br> Come on a hike into The UX Forest! Participate in rapid landing page design challenges and affinity diagramming exercises. Find out why UX design is important, on the rise and how it can be applied to any digital product.<br> <br> Explore the Community Partner Harbour and meet alumni and their portfolios of work with our Community Partners. Community Partners are either non-profits or impact based start-ups within the city. In the Harbour you can pick up some connections and great design inspiration. <br> <br> Finally stay for Party Town to have a coffee, get a chance to win a free Essentials design course, and network with Vancouver's design community."
