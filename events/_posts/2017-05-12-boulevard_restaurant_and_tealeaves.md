description: "TEALEAVES x Boulevard #LanguageOfAroma - Culinary Explorations Inspired by Tea & Aroma<br> <br> Join TEALEAVES for an AROMA-themed tasting experience inspired by tea at Boulevard Kitchen & Oyster Bar. Explore how AROMA affects taste with Executive Chef Alex Chen through his tea-inspired entreé.<br> <br> About TEALEAVES #LanguageOfAroma:<br> <br> TEALEAVES is one of the very few tea blenders in the world, and we take precision very seriously. Why? Because in luxury, it’s the details that matter. TEALEAVES blends teas specifically for color, alongside aroma and taste, with understanding that “the first taste is with the eyes—but a shared understanding of aroma can add color to your world”. As part two of the TEALEAVES #PaletteForYourPalate project in collaboration with Pantone, Microsoft Design and world-class chefs and mixologists, we explore tea + color + mood + aroma through our bespoke culinary experiences. <br> "
