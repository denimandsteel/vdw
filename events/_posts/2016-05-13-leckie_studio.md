title: "Leckie Studio"
description: "Leckie Studio Architecture + Design Inc. is an interdisciplinary design studio based in Vancouver, Canada. The studio was founded in 2015 by principal architect Michael Leckie. We engage in the practice of design across a variety of scales and media - including architecture, interiors, installations, and product design. Our residential and commercial projects are informed by an environmental sensitivity that includes an emphasis on passive solar design, and flexible, modular spaces. Our design process is committed to a rigorous process of discovery - the core of the practice relies on a deeply-rooted fascination with the act of making.<br> We have most recently been honoured with the Canadian Architect Award of Merit for the Backcountry Hut (2016), the Western Living Magazine Designers of the Year Arthur Erickson Memorial Award (2016). Our work has been featured in publications including Arcade, Azure, Canadian Architect, CNN Design, and Wallpaper, among others."
