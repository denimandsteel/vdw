title: "RED Academy Open Studio"
description: "Join us for interactive workshops at RED Academy and put yourself in the driver's seat of the design process. Don't know what any of these words mean? No problem! We love tech and we love to teach, so no experience is needed to make the most of our workshops across Vancouver Design Week.<br> <br> We'll be running these activities on UX/UI (user experience/user interface), throughout the day, so feel free to pop in and out to get a taste of what we have to offer.<br> <br> * Mood boards and colour theory<br> * Design challenges and inspiration<br> * User interface questionnaires<br> * Networking and community building<br> <br> After your journey, make sure to stop by Party Town for a coffee and a chance to win a free Essentials Design course. Use the time to network with Vancouver's design community and learn more about what RED Academy's about! <br> <br> In our programs, students work with Community Partners as their clients. These partners are either non profits or impact start-ups, because giving back is what we do. Itâ€™s the basis of our curriculum, the foundation of our education model, and the reason we show up day in and day out. If you're interested in getting involved as a Community Partner, be sure to get in touch!"
