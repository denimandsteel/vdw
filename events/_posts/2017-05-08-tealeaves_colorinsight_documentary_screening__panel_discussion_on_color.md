description: "An inspired documentary screening, #ColorInSight, and panel discussion will explore colour strategy, specifically, how brands across industries can harness the power of colour and how colour strategy can have a large impact on the perception of products and services.<br> <br> For companies, colour has long been a tool that the most memorable brands use to assert their identity. Colour has become an industry-agnostic tool that only the best brands wield to capture their audienceâ€™s attention."
