title: "Hapa Collaborative/Nick Milkovich Architects"
description: "For Vancouver Design Week we are reaching out to demonstrate the important role of landscape architecture and urban design in the everyday life of the city. We want to demonstrate how intrinsic our work is to the experience of the city and the positive change that design in the public realm helps facilitates. We'll showcase the recently completed North Plaza at the Vancouver Art Gallery, completed in partnership with our architectural colleagues and studio mates at Nick Milkovich Architects. Weâ€™ll show our models, poster boards, samples of hardscape material, and images of our projects, with a 10 minute presentation on the development process of the Vancouver Art Gallery North Plaza. <br> <br> Refreshments and secret giveaways will be available."
