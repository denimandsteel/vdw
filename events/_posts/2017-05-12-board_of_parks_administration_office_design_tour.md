title: "Board of Parks Administration Office Design Tour"
description: "On the edge of our world famous forested park sits a somewhat unassuming building that is, in fact, a portal to a different era of design. The Vancouver Parks Board Office in Stanley Park is perhaps our best-preserved, though still actively used, example of mid-century modernism.<br> <br> This rare tour will take you through a seldom-seen gem of our cityâ€™s government and design legacy."
