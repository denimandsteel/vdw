title: "Mosh Framemakers"
description: "Mosh framemakers create hand crafted, artisanal, bespoke eyeglass frames in their store and factory in stylish Gastown, downtown Vancouver, BC. <br> <br> Sara Moshurchak, the Head Honcho, Design Guru and Style Wizard along with her team of certified Canadian optical elves craft one of a kind, custom eyeglasses. By hand. Right here. Sara is only one of three women in the world handcrafting frames like this.<br> <br> We will open our studio to show how we handcraft eyewear, the creation of our next collection currently in progress, and some of the other fun projects in the pipeline. Liquid refreshments will be served. We also have a whole bunch of excess acetate plastic material that we'd love to give a good home to. So bring a small bag to load up on some amazingly colourful (and free) offcuts!"
