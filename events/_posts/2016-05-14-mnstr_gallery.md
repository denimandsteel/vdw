title: "MNSTR GALLERY"
description: "MNSTR Creative Studio + Gallery combines graphic design, art, printmaking, photography, and curation. We are a new artist studio in Mount Pleasant run by Ben & Oli, a husband and wife duo...part of the space is also our home. We are going to be exhibiting our individual and collaborative work in the coming months and eventually will curate shows for other artists. We were previously in Singapore and Australia the past 10 years to live + work before finding Vancouver as a new home at the beginning of 2016. Please check our @mnstrgallery account on Instagram for our progress.<br> <br> During the Vancouver Design Week(end), we are opening our studio up to visitors to showcase our physical artworks and to play a slideshow of our past and current projects.<br> <br> Ben (BenG: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bengsart.com\">www.bengsart.com</a>) Will be demonstrating his screen printing process during the show, this is the final step in his creative process taking digitally created imagery and applying it to the canvas by hand. Visitors can drop in any time throughout the process and watch how the prints are made. A VFX animator by day, Beng is a self taught screenprinter who creates poppy narative driven social commentary art works. These artworks will also be available for purchase through our website soon.<br> <br> Oli will be showing some of my photography work (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.osg.photography\">www.osg.photography</a>) and will have a studio lighting set up for still life/food and a workstation to demonstrate her workflow. Having a background in graphic design has helped her a lot with the creative direction in her photography work, styling and editing skills. “I have a passion for all things design and love to collaborate with other creatives.”<br> <br> Their collective experiences and skills have brought them to create their little monster (MNSTR) here in Vancouver. “We hope to contribute to the art and design scene in the city and are keen to connect with the creative community here... people with different focuses from designers, artists, craftsman, and those who are enthusiastic about visuals. Drop by and hang with us."
