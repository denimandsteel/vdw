title: "MNSTR GALLERY"
description: "MNSTR Creative Studio + Gallery combines graphic design, art, printmaking, photography, and curation. We are a new artist studio in Mount Pleasant run by us, Ben & Oli a husband and wife duo...part of the space is also our home. We are going to be exhibiting our individual and collaborative work in the coming months and eventually will curate shows for other artists. We were previously in Singapore and Australia the past 10 years to live + work before finding Vancouver as a new home at the beginning of 2016. Please check out our @mnstrgallery account on Instagram for our progress.  During the Vancouver Design Week(end), we would love to open our new studio up to visitors to showcase our physical artworks and to play a slideshow of our past and current projects with a projector in the space.  Ben (BenG: www.bengsart.com) is planning to set up his work space to share his process from his digital illustrations to the printed material on some of his selected works, and possibly a demo of hand pulled silk screen printing to show part of his workflow. An animator by day at a visual effects company, heâ€™s a self-taught printmaker who decided to create visual social commentary through the silkscreen printing process.  I (Oli) will be showing some of my photography work (www.osg.photography) and will have a studio lighting set up for still life/food and a workstation to demonstrate my workflow. Having a background in graphic design has helped me a lot with the creative direction in my photography work, styling and editing skills. I have a passion for all things design and love to collaborate with other creatives.   Our collective experiences and skills have brought us to create our little monster (MNSTR) here in Vancouver. We hope to contribute to the art and design scene in the city and are keen to connect with the creative community here... people with different focuses from designers, artists, craftsman, and those who are enthusiastic about visuals. We are thinking of other ways to make the studio visit more special, so we hope that VDW would consider us to be a part of the program this year."
