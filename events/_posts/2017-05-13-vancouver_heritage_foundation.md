description: "Revitalizing UBC: Cultural landscape and twentieth century design legacies.<br> <br> The University of British Columbia offers a rich design legacy to explore. More than that, the buildings and landscapes reflect key society forces that have historically shaped the place, including a significant collection of Mid-century Modern buildings that introduced fresh ideas on education and design.  As the campus continues to grow and evolve, UBC Campus and Community Planning has sought to understand the campus as a cultural landscape so that each rehabilitation project and new development contributes to this sense of place.<br> <br> Tour leaders Gerry McGeough, UBC University Architect, and Karen Russell, Manager, Development Services, will discuss these forces and themes that have shaped the campus over time, how these are informing current planning, and lessons learned as UBC seeks to apply emergent “values based” heritage conservation practices. We will learn about the history and development of key sites and buildings along the route, their design and the architects that conceived them, and how they fit into the bigger picture of the UBC campus.<br> <br> This walking tour is taking place in conjunction with Vancouver Design Week – Vancouver’s official interdisciplinary design festival."
