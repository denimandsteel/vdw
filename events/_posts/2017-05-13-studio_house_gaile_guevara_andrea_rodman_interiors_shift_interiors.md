title: "Studio House: Gaile Guevara, Andrea Rodman Interiors, Shift Interiors"
description: "We are a design studio collective made of four Design Studios who want to share a space not only to help support one another but as well to collectively build on the shared values of creating a stronger community between peers. We will showcase our process and unique approach to design while open discussion on the growing concerns of what it means to be a future Vancouverite. Through residential design, our projects enable us to provide an intimate insight into the changing needs of a growing demographic. We hope by sharing insight into the demands of better housing models, we can then educate the general public about their ability to participate in positive change. "
