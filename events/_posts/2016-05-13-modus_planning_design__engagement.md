description: "MODUS works with local and regional governments, provincial agencies, crown corporations, non-profits, universities, community groups, school boards, libraries and progressive developers to address their most critical issues and make a real difference.  MODUS will use several mediums to show how we get from insight to impact in our work as planners, designers, and engagement specialists. These will include videos we've produced, a photo reel, a design exercise, and boards displaying high-impact projects.   Modus is on the 4th floor. Take the elevator or the stairs, and we will greet you there."
