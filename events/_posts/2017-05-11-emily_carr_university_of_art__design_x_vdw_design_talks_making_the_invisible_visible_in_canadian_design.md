title: "Emily Carr University of Art + Design X VDW Design Talks: Making the Invisible Visible in Canadian Design"
description: "Western Canadian design stems from humble roots: our country's early practitioners were often anonymous, though their work impacted the everyday lives of citizens. They shaped Canada through design, creating the architecture, systems and products of a newly founded and developing country. As a result, Canadian design has been, in practice, largely unseen in Canadian life and in the international design market. <br> <br> Spend an evening with five designers whose work challenges this anonymity and brings attention to the value and impact that West Coast design contributes to on a local and a global scale. Five short presentations will be followed by a roundtable discussion and audience Q&A.<br>  <br> Speakers: Bonne Zabolotney (Vice President Academic + Provost, ECUAD); Mo Dhaliwal (Director of Strategy, Skyrocket Digital) David Battersby (Partner, BattersbyHowat Architects Inc.); Michael Leckie (Principal, Leckie Studio); and Kate Duncan (Designer, Kate Duncan Furniture Design). Moderated by Anicka Quin (Editorial Director, Western Living & Vancouver magazine) and Leanne Prain (President, GDC BC)."
