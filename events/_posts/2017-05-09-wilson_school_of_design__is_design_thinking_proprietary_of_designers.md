title: "Wilson School of Design - Is Design Thinking proprietary of Designers?"
description: "Many designers feel something has been taken from them, when professionals outside the design field talk and teach Design Thinking. But should they really? This talk would encourage the audience to participate in a conversation, where the conventional idea of Design will be challenged, and a wider understanding of the future role of designers in a complex and digital world will be explored."
