title: " Brasilia: Life After Design"
description: "Part ode, part critique, Bart Simpsonâ€™s film Brasilia: Life After Design takes the viewer on a sweetly surreal and slightly melancholic tour of a strange and monumental cityscape. The camera pans across sweeping urban vistas, peers through archways and down the long central axis, capturing images of random city dwellers spaced like birds on a wire around the perimeter of the enormous spaces between buildings."
