title: "How to make social change sticky?"
description: "Join this workshop by InWithForward, where we build organizational and community capacity to make & sustain bottom-up change. We're exploring what  'flourishing' looks like for the people we serve? What is the appetite for change? How can we create an environment for experimentation in social services? <br> <br> Come play with some of the frameworks and tools we use, that combine social science, implementation science, and design to develop deeper understanding that is actionable and propels change."
