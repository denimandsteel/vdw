title: "How to make social change sticky?"
description: "Workshop by InWithForward. We are building organizational and community capacity to make & sustain bottom-up change. We are exploring, what does flourishing look like for the people we serve? what is the appetite for change? How can we create an environment for experimentation in social services? Come play with some of the frameworks and tools we use, that combine social science, implementation science, and design to develop deeper understanding that is actionable and propels change."
