title: "The Cygnus Design Group"
description: "We are a multidisciplinary design firm, specializing in Architectural, Interior, Urban, and Industrial Design. Weâ€™re driven by sustainability, innovation and design excellence. Enter the building from Homer St. and take the elevator to the 6th floor. Here at our office we create communication solutions for the built environment; we dabble in multidisciplinary projects relating to wayfinding, branded environments, placemaking, experiential graphic design and much more. On your visit to our studio you will get to meet the brains behind the programs we execute, see some of our work, and perhaps get a hands on understanding of what it takes to work on projects that bridge a variety of practices to create memorable experiences. Of course, some yummy treats and tunes will be had."
