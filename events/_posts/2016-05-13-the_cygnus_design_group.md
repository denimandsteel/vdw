title: "The Cygnus Design Group"
description: "Come and visit our Perkins+Will Studio: A Candy Factory in its former life, the building at 1220 Homer St has been converted to become our working studio. We are a multidisciplinary design firm, specializing in Architectural, Interior, Urban, and Industrial Design. Weâ€™re driven by sustainability, innovation and design excellence. Enter the building from Homer St. The elevator is broken, so prepare for an experiential hike up to the sixth floor. We promise it is worth it.  Here at Cygnus we create communication solutions for the built environment; we dabble in multidisciplinary projects relating to wayfinding, branded environments, placemaking, experiential graphic design and much more. On your visit to our studio you will get to meet the brains behind the programs we execute, see some of our work, and perhaps get a hands on understanding of what it takes to work on projects that bridge a variety of practices to create memorable experiences. Of course, some yummy treats and tunes will be had."
