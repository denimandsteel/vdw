title: "Wilson School of Design: City As A Spaceship: Urban Planning"
description: "City As A Spaceship is a metaphorical movement in urban planning - a new way of thinking about humans and their relationships with their habitats - an intelligent way of designing future cities. Product Design instructor Sue Fairburn hopes to provoke an active discussion about the future of cities.<br> <br> Sue discusses making cities self-sufficient, like a space station. Spaceship and space habitats are comparable to the modern, densely packed, and technology-driven metros of tomorrow.<br> https://www.facebook.com/events/618066951869379/"
