title: "Crosstown Elementary School"
description: "Crosstown Elementary is a new 4 storey school for 510 children integrated within a complex development consisting of 2 existing residential towers/podium & Daycare. The school is the first of itâ€™s kind for the VSB and forms the model for future urban schools in Vancouver. The design was directly influenced by the complicated site as well as 21st Century Learning Principles, encouraging project based learning and more spacious open areas outside of regular classrooms. In conjunction with the new school, the western end of Andy Livingston Park was upgraded by the CoV to be used by general public and school alike."
