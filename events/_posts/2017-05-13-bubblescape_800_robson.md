The Vancouver Design Nerds and Frida&Frank believe that designed public spaces of play, curiosity and conversations about the issues we care about can have big impact! Visit Bubblescape at Robson Square for 5 days of pop-up experiences. Our daily programming partners will enliven our inflatable bubble spaces, showing you first hand how they use design to create impact. Plus surprise activities and guests to be announced. Watch the nerds on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as we reveal our BIG plans for VDW!<br> <br> Sponsored by VIVA Vancouver <br> VIVA Vancouver is a program that transforms road spaces into vibrant people spaces.<br> In collaboration with community groups, local businesses, and regional partners, VIVA facilitates short- and long-term street closures, creating public spaces for walking, lounging, and lunching."
