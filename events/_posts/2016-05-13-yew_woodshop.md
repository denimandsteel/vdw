title: "Yew Woodshop"
description: "The Yew WoodShop is a shared woodworking space established by four Emily Carr students who met in the the Industrial Design program. <br> <br> Within, separate businesses co-exist to share resources, ideas and knowledge along with high performance shop equipment.<br> Specializing in using local and reclaimed materials, the crew at Yew takes on a diverse range of projects that include doors, furniture, sculpture, signage and other custom products. <br> <br> Current residents of the shop include OGA Design, House of Doors, Daly Co., Willow & Stump, VanAir Designs, Justin Davis and Benjamin McLaughlin.<br> See examples of past projects that demonstrate the materials, techniques and specialized production processes we use to solve complex and creative design challenges.<br> <br> Experience collaborative design through the trifecta of SPACE, Yew Woodshop, and Daly Co. Better yet, meet the pioneers who are driving innovation in Vancouverâ€™s hyper-local design and manufacturing community."
