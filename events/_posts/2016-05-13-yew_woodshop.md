title: "Yew Woodshop"
description: "The Yew WoodShop is a shared woodworking studio run by its members who met in university at Emily Carr in the Industrial Design program. Within the space, separate businesses work alongside one another in order to share ideas, resources and shop facilities. Specializing in using reclaimed and local materials, the Yew WoodShop takes on a diverse range of projects that include (but are not limited to) wood product development, wood doors, furniture production, art and sculpture, retail displays/signage and other custom solid wood products for the built environment.  During the opening, we will have a number of projects on display (past, present and future) an some demos of the specialty processes we use to fabricate our work. Each group within the space will be representing them selves, so guests will get to see an array of work from a single space.   In tangent with SPACE across the street, these two environments will showcase the various stages of development needed to turn an idea into a physical object.
