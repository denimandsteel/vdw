title: "Hapa Collaborative"
description: "Hapa Collaborative is a landscape architecture and urban design practice established with placemaking, attentiveness and collaboration in mind.<br> <br> We see each project as an opportunity to partner, dream big and synthesize ideas wrought from many, often opposing, influences.  Our goal is to evoke the poetry of the place and in doing so reveal something delightful but perhaps previously unseen.  Most of all, we consider Hapa to be a contemporary voice for landscape architecture and a small, agile and fresh alternative to traditional firms.<br>  <br> Our joint open concept studios allow visitors to see actual working spaces and collaborative areas of our studio, shared with Nick Milkovich Architects. Hapa team members will be present to answer questions about Architectural models and drawings on display, give a tour, as well as a preview of ongoing projects including the Vancouver Art Gallery North Plaza, Foot of Lonsdale Plaza (featuring the completed Megabench) and the completed Megaphone aka Jim Deva Plaza Speaker's Corner feature at the Bute & Davie Plaza.<br>  <br> Refreshments, snacks, growlers of beer and some wine will be provided. Visitors may go home with free Sun Hop Park t-shirts, limited supply.<br>  <br> Door code is 4403 (under Hapa), and the elevator will give you access to the 4th floor on entry."
