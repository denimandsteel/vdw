title: "Hapa Collaborative"
description: "Hapa Collaborative offers professional services in landscape architecture and urban design, working the full breadth of scale: master plans and streetscapes to pocket parks, private residences and green roofs. <br> <br> Using the principles of landscape urbanism, Hapa strives to provide contemporary design. A fresh alternative to the traditional approach to landscape architecture, we enjoy exploring new materials and revealing unique aspects of the environment.<br> <br> Our joint open concept studios allow visitors to see actual working spaces and collaborative areas of our studio, shared with Nick Milkovich Architects. Hapa team members will be present to answer questions about Architectural models and drawings on display, give a tour, as well as a preview of ongoing projects including the Vancouver Art Gallery North Plaza, Foot of Lonsdale Plaza (featuring the completed Megabench) and the completed Megaphone aka Jim Deva Plaza Speaker's Corner feature at the Bute & Davie Plaza. <br> <br> Refreshments, snacks, growlers of beer and some wine will be provided. Visitors may go home with free Sun Hop Park t-shirts, limited supply.<br> <br> Door code is 4403 (under Hapa), and the elevator will give you access to the 4th floor on entry. No ticket required."
