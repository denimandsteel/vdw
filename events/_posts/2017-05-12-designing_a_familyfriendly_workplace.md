title: "Designing a Family-Friendly Workplace"
description: "A group of Vancouver-based parents, entrepreneurs and creatives are developing the business case for Nestworks, a new non-profit startup dedicated to reimagining work/life balance. If this resonates with you, bring your ideas to help us grow this exciting project! How could we redesign our workplaces to better accommodate our family needs? What opportunities for social innovation, creativity and improved mental health - among other positive impacts - may present themselves when we reframe the traditional binary of \"work\" and \"life\" to be more integrated, instead of separate?"
