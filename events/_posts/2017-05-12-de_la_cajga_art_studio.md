title: "De La Cajga Art Studio"
description: "The expected growth of our city makes for a carefully orchestrated project. The available land is limited by water and mountains -our fixed boundaries. I am free to do what architects and developers can only dream of doing. I bend engineers’ protocols and planners’ minds to construct new urban environments. Photography and imagination combine and allow me to move and reshape buildings.<br>  <br> In these times when real estate prices are hitting the roof, I multiply the land available and bring the matter -through illusion- to the fore. Will such imaginary constructions become a seed that generates alternatives beneficial to the future inhabitants of our city? I hope so. As a creator, I express what my mind sees. The works presented are meant to incite thinking. I do not claim to know what should be done. I want our city to continue being a unique livable space -a paradise some would say- for decades to come. Look at what surrounds us! Imagine what our actions today will turn into tomorrow. We are responsible for what we leave to future generations."
