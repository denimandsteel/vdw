title: "\"Why We Cycle\" Vancouver Premiere"
description: "Modacity and HUB Cycling are proud to co-present the Vancouver premiere of the Dutch film “Why We Cycle”. This delightful documentary takes a ride with ordinary cyclists and specialists from a variety of disciplines. These conversations uncover some obvious, but even more hidden effects of cycling, on people, on societies, and on the organization of cities. The 56-minute film will be followed by a half-hour panel discussion with local politicians, bike advocates, and business leaders.<br> "
