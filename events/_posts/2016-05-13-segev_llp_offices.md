title: "Segev LLP Offices"
description: "Executed in two phases, Carscadden worked with Segev LLP to convert what was previously an open design studio to a series of discrete offices that  - wait for it...  still felt like an open design studio. The program brief in this respect was a function of the often private and sensitive nature of legal work, and the young firm's ambition to not communicate the 19th Century feel that many law office do."
