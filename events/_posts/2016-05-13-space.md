title: "SPACE"
description: "SPACE is host to a group of multidisciplinary artists, designers, entrepreneurs and oddballs, all with a collective mission to activate the cultural and creative potential of communities and cities at large.  The newly established showroom in the front of SPACE will be the focus of this years Vancouver Design Week festivities, where we will be featuring the work of a number of local Vancouver Designers. We have created this showroom as a platform for designers to turn ideas into products and showcase them alongside other designers from the community. Our showroom runs on a low margin model, which allows us to sell goods at a more affordable price and puts more money back into the designers pockets so they can keep making. Our space is one that is always in transition, morphing to accommodate the variety of activities we host, so there will be plenty more to see!  Our opening is done in tangent with the Yew Woodshop right across the street where much of the work we create is manufactured. With both being shared work spaces, we want to showcase how an emerging independent workforce is working together to create shared value amongst one another.   We are combined is retail, maker space and studios. Together we explore new dimensions of creativity in the vessel known as SPACE."
