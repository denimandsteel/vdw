title: "SPACE"
description: "Permission to come aboard the vessel known as SPACE -- granted. Within SPACE you’ll find a group of multidisciplinary artists, designers, entrepreneurs, and oddballs, working beneath the stars, ping-pong balls, and a replica WWI biplane.<br> <br> This week(end), we’re stoked to debut [The Orbital Trading Post], a street facing showroom which exists to promote the stories, skills and products of Vancouver’s talented artists, designers, and creatives. You can expect to see work from: Daly Co., OGA Design, Willow & Stump, Studio Corelam, Shipway, Ben Barber Studio, Propellor and Nocturnal Workshop.<br> <br> [The Orbital Trading Post] runs on a low margin model, allowing us to sell quality goods at a price which makes customers and designers very, very happy! The OTP is the access point to the best of emerging design made in Vancouver.<br> <br> We believe our collective potential is unleashed when people connect and collaborate. Come on by, tell us your story, we’ll tell you ours, and together we can explore new dimensions of inspiration and creativity.<br> Experience collaborative design through the trifecta of SPACE, Yew Woodshop, and Daly Co. Better yet, meet the pioneers who are driving innovation in Vancouver’s hyper-local design and manufacturing community."
