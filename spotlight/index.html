          <p class="golf">1 Design is / design can _______?</p>
          <p>Design is just a word. One that seems to be overused and understood by many. Yet one of the most important concepts with myriad forms of impact on the human experience. Design is a powerful tool—for good and bad. Some say that design can change the world, but I would argue that design has already changed the world more than any other action of mankind. And design is needed now more than ever before.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Ouch. This questions always stings. There is no such thing as no design, just bad design. And bad design ruins lives, literally. Perhaps the simple answer is that design is literally the antithesis of chaos, and so very much of everything we encounter in life is the result of design. Not guesses. Not contests or crowdsourcing. It’s the result of informed, experienced, design professionals applying rigorous process to create solutions that make the human experience better, healthier, more sustainable.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Vancouver is young, diverse, and progressive. It is a city in ascension, with the freedom to forge its own path without the baggage so many old and larger metropolises endure. I have encountered an enthusiasm and creative spirit of innovation in Vancouver unlike many cities I’ve visited, yet Vancouver possesses a sort of naiveté still, and a unique cultural, geographic, and economic perspective that in many ways serves as an advantage. </p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>This city is pregnant with creative potential. There’s all sorts of example of impact, from architecture to agriculture and applied arts, from fashion to film and food, from games to graphics, and sciences to sustainability—Vancouver has been quietly producing world-class design for decades. But to be honest, although Vancouver punches above its weight, it has not achieved close to its potential yet. With increased awareness, support, collaboration, and policy that encourages the various design sectors, the region could one day become a tour centre of excellence—a “design city.”</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>There have been times where my design efforts have helped groups understand who they really are and find the vision and focus needed to thrive. Also, I’m most excited whenever I’ve been able to tap into the collective genius of communities and intelligence of end users that result in new ideas and interventions.</p>

          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>We do not have old traditions of industry like other countries. It liberates us to create whatever we want. Therefore being able to lead in innovative design.</p>

          <p>Showing that it's possible to have an elegant, well made product that is made ethically and sustainably. I'd like this to become the norm for all business models.</p>

          <p>D&rsquo;Arcy Jones Architecture is a local, Vancouver based practice.

          <p>Design can be quiet or loud.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Everything unnatural that humans ever encounter was designed by someone:  designed well, designed poorly, designed by a group, designed by an individual, designed for humanity, designed for institutionalization, designed for individuals, designed for the public, designed to last, designed to be trendy, designed flippantly, designed carefully, designed to save money, designed to flaunt money or designed to create value. This collectively creates our experience in the world, so design matters if we care about our experience or want to improve it. </p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Vancouver has a large proportion of designers who are not from Vancouver. This is unique, and creates a design culture that is outward-looking and tends to look for inspiration globally. </p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Vancouver design has the greatest impact when it embraces regionalism, our grey climate, our nature and pluralism, stirring the pot to make something new. </p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>My studio works hard create inventive and interesting design that is neighbour-friendly, user-friendly and quiet. With our 430 House, the silhouette and structure of an unspectacular house from the 1980’s was entirely re-built inside. It is easy to drive or walk by this house and not even notice it, but at the interior we sculpted Vancouver’s soft grey light into modern and gracious spaces. </p>
