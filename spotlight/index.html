          <p class="golf">1 Design is / design can _______?</p>
          <p>Design is, and should always be a form of clear communication. Whether it be typography, photography, logos or iconography or even fine art for that matter, there are visual cues about the message and feeling behind it.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Design matters because the goal is to simplify the messages to be communicated. It is a vessel that message the most efficient way and then be digested by the viewer. I mentioned fine art above and that can be a bit muddy, but even if your message as the artist is about them struggling to communicate in that realm, it is still a message.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Design based in Vancouver differentiates from the rest of the world I think due to our location having an influence on how people work and shape their days, weeks, seasons and years. We also are a very young city in a young country. This gives Vancouver the ability to grow and flex. Growing up here I find the outdoors an incredibly heavy influence on my thought patterns and thinking. While that is me as an individual, it is visible in many of the brands that are founded here as well.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Vancouver design, working with many of the brands founded and growing in Vancouver are bringing a great visibility to focus on health, wellness, exercise, and the outdoors. This is a great trend to see rising globally or at least in western culture.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>Relating back to health, and being outdoors, I've worked in that field and doing some very fun campaigns focusing on getting viewers out to explore and utilize their favorite activities, and in turn returning that joy by putting back into the community. While the focus and locations were all based in British Columbia, it is the shared interest over the activity that helps it apply to a more international audience. Hopefully there can be more projects on the horizon to help people relate to what they do and put back in towards their communities, and also themselves.</p>

          <p>Design can be quiet or loud.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Everything unnatural that humans ever encounter was designed by someone:  designed well, designed poorly, designed by a group, designed by an individual, designed for humanity, designed for institutionalization, designed for individuals, designed for the public, designed to last, designed to be trendy, designed flippantly, designed carefully, designed to save money, designed to flaunt money or designed to create value. This collectively creates our experience in the world, so design matters if we care about our experience or want to improve it. </p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Vancouver has a large proportion of designers who are not from Vancouver. This is unique, and creates a design culture that is outward-looking and tends to look for inspiration globally. </p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Vancouver design has the greatest impact when it embraces regionalism, our grey climate, our nature and pluralism, stirring the pot to make something new. </p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>My studio works hard create inventive and interesting design that is neighbour-friendly, user-friendly and quiet. With our 430 House, the silhouette and structure of an unspectacular house from the 1980’s was entirely re-built inside. It is easy to drive or walk by this house and not even notice it, but at the interior we sculpted Vancouver’s soft grey light into modern and gracious spaces. </p>
