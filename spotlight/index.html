          <p>Marianne Amodio Architecture Studio blurs the dichotomy between the whimsical and practical features of architecture. They are primarily focused on finding innovative ways to to densify properties without losing the usefulness and feel of a single family dwelling. It’s thrilling to have such a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" class="u-color-red"target="_blank" href="http://www.maastudio.com">relevant and original studio</a> a part of our Vancouver Design Week network.</p>

          <p>My son would say that design can change the world (see attached - his VDW card from 2 years ago). This might appear a trite view, but we do actually believe it.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Design matter because it subconsciously affects our everyday, from the smallest moments to the most profound.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Our attention to the landscape, adjacent and beyond. It becomes inextricably linked to the work, as though it already began as a part of it. Also, while Vancouver design can play with the best of them on an international stage, we are still, in many ways, small town and homey.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Easily, we can see that our values as a sustainable culture is having an enormous impact in how we build buildings in Vancouver. More subliminally, I think as a community we are a bit outliers; something slightly divergent from the norm.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>The work that we are doing with the densification of smaller lot properties is very exciting to us. Providing a home for several generations of the same family, or increasing the longevity of an existing building by adding density is rewarding work.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Nature and creativity. We in Vancouver have the essence of nature all around us – we have oceans, mountains, forests, mountains, sky, fresh air. Our environment influences everyone here to be more creative. I graduated in sculpture from Emily Carr University in 1978. Emily Carr’s President Ron Burnett also said recently that our beautiful local environment is a great influence on art students, making Emily Carr such a prestigious institution.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Vancouver has an advantage – geographically it is far away from design hubs such as New York and Toronto, meaning it is away from these influences. In Vancouver we can design using our own unique ideas.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>I am proud of any time that I have influenced someone to admire and appreciate nature through my work.</p>

          <p>Design illuminates the potential of a thing or idea.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>To design is to improve. Go ahead and swap "improving" for "design" and "Why does improving matter?" becomes a rather silly question.</p>

        <div class="eight push-two lg-push-four columns">
          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>The Vancouver design community is small and geographically isolated, so it inevitably looks outward. And it's young, so it's inclined toward the new. This provides an incubator effect with significant cross-pollination across disciplines — fashion, industrial, decor, architecture, tech. Burnkit takes inspiration from this wider group as much as from our fellow graphic designers.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>The outside world has a picture of Vancouver in it's mind (it photographs well, doesn't it?): It's beautiful, there are mountains and gleaming towers, it's progressive, it's casual, it's new. It's a superficial identity, but "beautiful, progressive and new" isn't the worst place for a designer to start from. Vancouver design that's made impact furthest afield often takes advantage of these notions.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>I'm proud of the successes we've had working with other design businesses that we take inspiration from including, Bocci, Reigning Champ, Herschel and Bing Thom, among others. Burnkit is fortunate that organizations choose us because of our approach to the work, rather than because we have experience within a particular industry. That's how we've had the opportunity to work with an amazing array of companies doing good things in their respective fields including the arts, technology, fashion, film, design, real estate, sciences, resources, law and education.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Vancouver's wet coastal climate fosters design that both stands out and holds up against the elements. There is level of practicality that needs to be woven into the construct of things.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>We are still a young city. As Vancouverites, we're finding our way in having influence further afield. In the process of this, there's a freedom to shape the form and function of objects to suit our needs.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>

          <p class="golf">1 Design is / design can _______?</p>
          <p>Design is, and should always be a form of clear communication. Whether it be typography, photography, logos or iconography or even fine art for that matter, there are visual cues about the message and feeling behind it.</p>
          <p class="golf">2 Why does it matter?</p>
          <p>Design matters because the goal is to simplify the messages to be communicated. It is a vessel that message the most efficient way and then be digested by the viewer. I mentioned fine art above and that can be a bit muddy, but even if your message as the artist is about them struggling to communicate in that realm, it is still a message.</p>

          <p class="golf">3 What differentiates Vancouver design (from the rest of the world)?</p>
          <p>Design based in Vancouver differentiates from the rest of the world I think due to our location having an influence on how people work and shape their days, weeks, seasons and years. We also are a very young city in a young country. This gives Vancouver the ability to grow and flex. Growing up here I find the outdoors an incredibly heavy influence on my thought patterns and thinking. While that is me as an individual, it is visible in many of the brands that are founded here as well.</p>
          <p class="golf">4 What impact is (Vancouver) design having?</p>
          <p>Vancouver design, working with many of the brands founded and growing in Vancouver are bringing a great visibility to focus on health, wellness, exercise, and the outdoors. This is a great trend to see rising globally or at least in western culture.</p>
          <p class="golf">5 What design impacts are you most proud of / what impact potential are you most excited about?</p>
          <p>Relating back to health, and being outdoors, I've worked in that field and doing some very fun campaigns focusing on getting viewers out to explore and utilize their favorite activities, and in turn returning that joy by putting back into the community. While the focus and locations were all based in British Columbia, it is the shared interest over the activity that helps it apply to a more international audience. Hopefully there can be more projects on the horizon to help people relate to what they do and put back in towards their communities, and also themselves.</p>

          <p>My studio works hard create inventive and interesting design that is neighbour-friendly, user-friendly and quiet. With our 430 House, the silhouette and structure of an unspectacular house from the 1980’s was entirely re-built inside. It is easy to drive or walk by this house and not even notice it, but at the interior we sculpted Vancouver’s soft grey light into modern and gracious spaces. </p>
